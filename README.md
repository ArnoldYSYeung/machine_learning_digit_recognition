Using a multi-class Logistic Regression and a Neural Network with regularization to identify handwritten digits

Developed and written by Arnold Yeung

This project runs multi-class logistic regression and neural network with regularization for a dataset containing the pixels of handwritten digits.  The dataset used is a subset of MNIST handwritten digits (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist).

This project is based on Exercises 3 and 4 in Coursera course, Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, Stanford University (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

All scripts and functions attached in this project, with the following exceptions, were written by Arnold Yeung:
  - fmincg.m
  - displayData.m

The main pipeline script is run.m
